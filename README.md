Okay, here's the game plan!

To-dos:
  - post what I have online...

- Find an old website or video game that I used to like as a kid...
  - Geocities
  - R-Type?
  Nah... something with distinctive colour and style, without emphasized dynamicness...
  - *Final Fantasy VII* ðŸŽ¶ðŸ˜¢ so æ„ŸåŠ¨

- Color:
  - The opening screen of FF7 is mostly black and smoggy, with a flash of light-turqoise
    - I.e., black, charcoal gray, turqoise, white... default card-bg is radial darkish blue to navy blue
  - Might add cards w/ blue bg, white text
- Typography:
  - Look through Google fonts for a free font that resembles the header and subtext of opening screen
- Spacing:
  - Opening scene header has much space
  - Opening scene subtext seems to have uniform spacing
- Imagery:
  - Lots of lossy JPG...?

- Required components:
  - Header
    - black text with white outline
  - Footer
    - status/equipment screen (full-width blue to black)
    - e.g. https://youtu.be/UIIq1hSj0GY?t=1551
  - Anchor tag / Link styling
    - Preceded by pointing-hand icon
    - e.g. https://youtu.be/TImnKC8v41c?t=499
  - Buttons (we recommend a few different styles
    - Card with overlapping pointer-hand icon
    - e.g. https://youtu.be/TImnKC8v41c?t=604
  - Cards
    - Card with no overlapping pointer-hand icon
    - https://youtu.be/TImnKC8v41c?t=571
  - Plain text styling (a few different styles
    - opening screen header
    - opening screen subtext
    - card text
  - h1/h2/h3/h4/h5/h6 tag styling
    - hmm... having some trouble thinking of how to incorporate this...
    - I think a variety of header-sizes would compromise the theme...
      - should try it out anyways...
  - Image
    - pointer-hand
    - logo of meteor
  - Ordered & unordered lists
    - unordered:
      https://youtu.be/TImnKC8v41c?t=600
    - ordered: 
      same as unordered, preceded by number with period
      ... is this how they did it? ðŸ¤” maybe I should look into it...
      I feel like if I'm wrong, no one will ever notice, though...
      unless they read this note-to-self... ðŸ˜¬ðŸ¤£
  - Sections
    - width of the sections...
      - neither centered or full-width sections will feel like FF7...
      - cramming lots of stuff into a small place in style then,
        so it should probably be centered

- Nice to have:
  - Tables
  - Dropdowns
  - Sidebars
  - Image carousels
  - Video player
  - Calendar

- The next step:
  - Landing page
    - Has a beautiful & clearly worded home page that explains what your project is all about.
    - Has a section that documents all your components. See https://material.io/components/date-pickers
    - Has 3 different sample pages, with different layouts that use your design system
    - Links back to your project on Mintbean
    

- important note for building the website:
  - not really sure how to deploy this stuff just yet... 
  - since we're using tailwind css, it involves some NodeJS scripts...
      - so is it possible to deploy using... parcel-bundler like last time?
