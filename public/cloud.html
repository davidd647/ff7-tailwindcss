            Cloud Strife (Japanese: クラウド・ストライフ, Hepburn: Kuraudo
            Sutoraifu) is a fictional character and the main protagonist of
            Square's (now Square Enix's) 1997 role-playing video game Final
            Fantasy VII, its high-definition remake, and several of its sequels
            and spinoffs. In Final Fantasy VII, Cloud is a mercenary claiming to
            be formerly of SOLDIER, a group of elite supersoldiers employed by
            the Shinra Electric Power Company, a megacorporation responsible for
            draining the life from the planet. Fighting against Shinra in the
            resistance group AVALANCHE, and driven by a feud with the primary
            antagonist, Sephiroth, Cloud learns to accept his troubled past and
            adapts to his role as a leader.

        <h3 class="color-primary">Concept and Design:</h3>

        <p>
          In contrast to Final Fantasy VI, which featured multiple "main
          characters", Square's staff decided at the outset of Final Fantasy
          VII's development that the game would follow a single identifiable
          protagonist.[2] In Hironobu Sakaguchi's first plot treatment, a
          prototype for Cloud's character belonged to an organization attempting
          to destroy New York City's "Mako Reactors".[3] After a pause in
          development so that the team could help finish Chrono Trigger, Square
          began experimenting with next-generation hardware.[3] A small group
          including Kitase and Nomura worked in secret to develop a demo for a
          Nintendo 64 emulation kit running on an SGI Onyx.[3] In addition to
          testing models ported from Square's 1995 SIGGRAPH demo, Nomura and a
          handful of other artists created new characters, including an early
          design of Cloud.[3]

      <section>
        <h3 class="color-primary">Voice Actors:</h3>

        <p>
          For the Ehrgeiz fighting game, Kenyu Horiuchi provided Cloud's voice
          in the arcade version while Nozomu Sasaki replaced him in the home
          console version.[54] Teruaki Sugawara, the voice director behind
          Kingdom Hearts, recommended Takahiro Sakurai, Cloud's Japanese voice
          actor, to Nomura for the role.[55] Nomura had originally asked Sakurai
          to play the protagonist of video game The Bouncer, Sion Barzahd, but
          found that his voice best suited Cloud after hearing him speak.[55]
          Sakurai received the script without any accompanying visuals, and
          first arrived for recording under the impression that he would be
          voicing a different character other than Cloud.[56] For Advent
          Children, Nomura wanted to contrast Cloud and Vincent's voices given
          their similar personalities.[57] As a sequel to the highly popular
          Final Fantasy VII, Sakurai felt greater pressure performing the role
          than he did when he voiced Cloud for Kingdom Hearts. Sakurai received
          comments from colleagues revealing their love of the game, some of
          them jokingly threatening that they would not forgive Sakurai if he
          did not meet their expectations.[56]
